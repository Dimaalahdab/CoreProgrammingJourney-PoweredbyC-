Problem Title: List Items with Proper English (Using "and" before the last item)

Description:
-------------
This program asks the user how many items they want to enter and then takes each item as input one by one.
It builds a properly formatted English list:
- Commas are added between items.
- The word "and" is used before the last item, as done in natural English speech and writing.

Example:
---------
Input:
How many item will you enter: 3
Add the item number 1 : apple
Add the item number 2 : banana
Add the item number 3 : strawberry

Output:
apple, banana, and strawberry

Time Complexity:
----------------
O(n)
Where 'n' is the number of items. Each item is read and added to the string once.

Space Complexity:
------------------
O(n)
All items are stored in a single string that grows as the number of items increases.

Limitations:
------------
- The string concatenation inside the loop may cause performance issues for very large input sizes due to repeated copying (can behave like O(n^2) in rare worst cases).
- No error handling for non-string inputs.
- The list is printed at the end only (no real-time list building or editing).

Possible Improvements (Suggestions for Later):
-----------------------------------------------
1. Use a dynamic array (vector<string>) to store items, then join them afterward.
2. Add error handling for invalid input types.
3. Allow the user to remove or edit items before final output.
4. Provide an option to output the list in other formats (e.g., bullet points).
5. Store the list in a text file.
